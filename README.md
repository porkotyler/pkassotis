### There is no greater thrill in life than running an app successfully with no errors. ðŸ§  

I'm a software engineer ***slash*** video game developer based in Athens, Greece and I'm here to experiment with as many [projects](https://linktr.ee/pkassotis) as I can. I've worked on [video games](https://github.com/pkassotis/Gluttony-App), [video game engines](https://github.com/pkassotis/GDevelop-Mobile), a [universal video game microtransaction cryptocurrency](https://github.com/vedra-xyz), [several Python programs](https://github.com/pkassotis?tab=projects), and Iâ€™m particularly interested in machine learning. Iâ€™m a [Developer Program Member](https://developer.github.com/program), the project manager behind [GitHub FOSS](https://github.com/GitHub-FOSS) and the captain of [GitHub's Jolly Rogers](https://github.com/github-jolly-rogers). Currently I'm working on a few [metaverse-related](https://github.com/github-mrp) projects for [Facebook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pkassotis/) and [Valve](https://github.com/steam-vr) and so far Iâ€™ve worked as a consultant and product engineer for companies like [Mozilla](https://community.mozilla.org/en/people/pkassotis/), [Rakuten](https://github.com/pkassotis/kassotis.com), and [Fiverr](https://github.com/pkassotis/marketplace.chaobear.com) (the company itself not its gigs). I'm also an [IT recruiter for Hunt Club](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bearofleipzig/), referring talented coders to tech companies all over the world. According to [Clarke's Third Law](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305678.001.0001/acref-9780195305678-e-70) any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and I intent on casting many spells here on GitHub. Feel free to go through my [README files](https://github.com/pkassotis/pkassotis/tree/main/Files) to view my full resume and certifications. I'm open to speaking engagements, meetups, podcasts, etc.
